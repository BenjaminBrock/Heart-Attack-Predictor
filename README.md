# Heart-Attack-Predictor 

## Using Kaggle Data set to predict heart attacks using other datapoints

This was a fun little afternoon Kaggle challenge, in which you take a series of health markers provided in the CSV and predict whether that individual is likely to have or have had a heart attack. Overall, this has some use potential, but overall there is not enough data here for any viable product and the data is almost certainly overfit.
